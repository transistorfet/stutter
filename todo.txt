	* add redefinition support to add_variable
	* add erase variable command
	* finish implementing namespace and incorperate changes into variable and command
	* what name do we use for the main core file?
	* how will information such as links be handling in both irc and http?

	* what should be passed to get_current, next, last, etc in order to determine which "group" of
	  widgets it is in reference to?  Should it be based on a widget, a widget's parent, a named
	  group, a type of widget, or maybe even a combination of these?
	* should fe_refresh have the ability to refresh part of the screen (a widget) as well as the
	  whole screen (by passing NULL) or is refresh not even necessary>
	* how will main_idle and the frontend interact?  should main be able to not return if it wishes?
	  should there be a way to make a new thread through the frontend (or through nit)?  should
	  timedelays be normally done through the frontend (a call to net_wait) and main_idle being
	  intended to just check if the socket has info (requires modification to irc_check_msgs)?
	  Is there anything except keyboard and sockets that would need blocking checks (in other
	  words, can the frontend make the assumption that it need only block on all sockets for the
	  current process?  (how will this work for gtk?  win32 can have 2 threads; one blocking on
	  windows messages and the other on net sockets (even if there are no net sockets?))?
	* do we need more functions for widget type? (create, destroy, clear, print, move, resize, refresh)

	* backspace doesn't work for some people (displays ^? instead)
	* when history is scrolled through, the parameters to commands are not saved (I think this is because
	  the buffer is not saved until after the command parser has mangled the buffer) 
	* there is a bug such that if you try to say something in the status, the server says no such nick
	* the quit command is irc-specific but can it be made independant?
	* rewrite msg.c using the new nit/string module

	* add handling for CTCP commands
	* logging plugin
	* winamp control and display plugin
	* variable dispatch that reads a list maintained by irc.c as well as a list of dispatch callbacks
	  replacing the existing single callback in irc.c for dispatch by irc_check_msgs.
	* distinguish between server and irc network? (a network is an "irc_server" with a list of server
	  addresses)
	* pass realname to server when connecting

	* scripting support
	* multiserver
	* add support such that libnit can be automagically distributed and built alongside (awaiting
	  builder support for this)

	* decide on how attributes will work.  frontend will keep track of most of it but will the program
	  be able to override them and will it be on a global or local (to widget) basis?  will there be
	  an attribute stack for each widget?
	* can variables be "watched" such that when the value changes, a function is called? (is this needed)
	* how would something like channel change be monitored so that a function can be called to
	  update a variable value?  (eg. to update the value of a variable that is used as the input prompt)
	* add support to frontend for prompt?  would this be a widget type?

DONE:
	* add widget param to fe_refresh (NOT NOW)
	* change name of _widget functions (NO)
	* add param to bind_key to specify context (string of some sorts, key is a string too)
	* what about some kind of callback when a socket has data to be read?  what about this also
	  for keyboard input?  what about a timed alarm (of which main_idle, if needed, would use)?

- how do you get the surface to draw to in window, input, and statusbar
- can we have net not depend on terminal

- fix fonts
- change input to use generic key values rather than the windows.h constants
- store terminal structs in a list so that you can look up a terminal based
  on the HWND passed to the windows function.
- make a seperate function/module for parsing text for attribute chars
- convert window (and statubar?) to use the new format parser
